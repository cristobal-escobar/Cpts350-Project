# Analyzing Graph with BDD

## Description  
Analyzed and represented complex directed graphs as **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD)** using PyEDA. This project simplified graph manipulation and traversal.

## Features  
- **Graph Representation**: Converted graphs into BDDs for optimization.  
- **Graph Operations**: Performed traversal and pathfinding.  
- **Efficient Analysis**: Simplified operations for complex graphs.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **PyEDA**
